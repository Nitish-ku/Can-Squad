          Every legendary story has a squad at its core—whether it's
          superheroes, misfits, or just a bunch of people who know how to have a
          good time. And then there's Can Squad, a group so unique, so chaotic,
          and so undeniably epic that no words can truly capture our essence
          (but hey, we'll try!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Can Squad isn't just a name; it's an identity. We're four individuals,
          each bringing our own madness to the table, yet somehow, it all blends
          perfectly. From inside jokes that make zero sense to anyone else, to
          those deep, meaningful conversations at 2 AM, we’ve built something
          that’s more than just friendship—it’s a legacy of vibes, trust, and
          occasional stupidity.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1.1</h3>
        <p>
          Why ‘Can Squad’? Honestly, the origins of our name are as mysterious
          as our decision-making skills. Maybe it started as a joke, maybe it
          was destiny, or maybe we just really liked the word 'Can'—who knows?
          What we do know is that it stuck, and now it's a symbol of our bond,
          our trust, and our shared adventures (and misadventures).
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1.2</h3>
        <p>
          We’re the kind of squad that hypes each other up, roasts each other
          mercilessly, and somehow still sticks together through everything.
          Whether it's surviving the most embarrassing moments, plotting the
          next great idea, or simply existing in our chaotic harmony, Can Squad
          is a force to be reckoned with.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1.3</h3>
        <p>
          So, if you’re reading this, congratulations! You’ve just entered the
          world of Can Squad. A world where the only rule is: stick together,
          laugh often, and never let the madness die.
